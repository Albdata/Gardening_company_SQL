Analyzing the Business Issues in SQL

In this project we have to perform some questions that our client ( a gardening comapany) has regarding its customers, employees, orders, benefits, etc...
Our job here is to sort some issues out that the client needs to be solved as the most profitable country they work in, the total benefit they can obtain by working there, etc... 

The BD consists on 8 tables ( oficina, empleado, pedido, detalle_pedido, producto, gama_producto, cliente, pago) and they are related to each other. 

The objective of this project is to prove how SQL can help us solve the business problems we can find and from there, to develop the best solutions in order to improve the efficiency of our company.
